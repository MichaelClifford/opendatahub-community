# Update Documentation Working Group

The goal of this working group is to update the existing ODH documentation to reflect the current state of the project and to add data scientists usersâ€™ perspectives to the documentation. This group should also focus on creating a common thread that ties all the docs together with a single (or as few as possible) Machine Learning tasks that can be be solved with ODH.    

The [charter](charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the DevSecOps Working Group.
